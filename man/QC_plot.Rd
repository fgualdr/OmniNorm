\usage{
QC_plot(
  gnmsn_obj,
  design_path,
  custom_table = NULL,
  saving_path = NULL,
  norm_methods = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gnmsn_obj}{Path to a matrix (n Ã— m) where rows are features (e.g., genes, proteins, ChIP-seq peaks) and columns are samples.}

\item{design_path}{Path to the design matrix describing samples. It must include \code{Sample_ID}, \code{Sample_Condition}, and \code{Sample_Replicate} columns. Subconditions are defined by the \verb{_} separator.}

\item{custom_table}{Optional character vector of \code{Sample_ID}s to use as reference samples for normalization. If \code{"random"} is specified, selects ~30\% of samples randomly. (Default = NULL)}

\item{saving_path}{Full path where results are saved. Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{norm_methods}{Character vector of normalization methods to compare. Can include \code{"quantile_normalisation"}, \code{"median_of_ratios_normalization"}, \code{"uqua"}, \code{"tmm"}.}
}
\value{
Saves PCA plots and summary tables to the \verb{saving_path/Norm_quality/} directory. Returns NULL invisibly.
}
\description{
Performs quality control analysis via PCA and clustering across normalization methods.
