Description: 
    GeneralNormalizer is an R package that uses skewed mixture distribution fitting to normalize numerical 
    matrices, particularly effective for datasets with unbalanced distributions, such as transcriptomic, 
    proteomic, or ChIP-seq signal matrices. Supports sparse matrices via the Matrix package for high-performance 
    workflows like those used in single-cell analyses.
