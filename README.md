# OmniNorm

**OmniNorm** is an R package for robust normalization of numerical matrices using **mixtures of skewed distributions**. It is designed to handle complex, unbalanced datasets where standard normalization methods (e.g., median, quantile) fail — including **single-cell omics**, **bulk multi-omics**, and **noisy or degraded assays**.

## 🔍 Motivation

In many biological experiments, it is often assumed that:

- Most features are unchanged across conditions,
- Up- and down-regulated features are balanced.

However, **real-world data rarely follows these assumptions**. Perturbations may affect a large proportion of features, or introduce **directionally biased (skewed)** changes. In such cases, classical normalization can introduce significant artifacts.

**OmniNorm** addresses this by modeling pairwise log-ratio distributions using **skewed mixture models**, providing robust scaling across diverse datasets — including high-noise, high-sparsity data like single-cell experiments.

## 📈 Applications

OmniNorm has been tested and validated on a wide range of omics datasets, including:

- 🧬 **Bulk RNA-seq**
- 🧫 **Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)**
- 🧪 **ChIP-seq**
- 🔬 **ATAC-seq**
- 🧠 **Proteomics**
- 🧊 **CETSA-MS** and other degraded or noisy assays
